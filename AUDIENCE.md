# Who Toot-Toot Engineering Is For

Toot-Toot Engineering (TTE) is designed for people who work in multi-step, intention-heavy processes and want those processes to remain clear, reviewable, and reproducible over time.

Rather than targeting a single profession or toolchain, TTE supports a shared way of working: making structure explicit so both humans and AI systems can reason about it reliably.

The primary audiences below are ordered intentionally.

---

## Engineers

Engineers work in systems that must be understandable, reviewable, and maintainable over time.

TTE helps engineers by treating workflow design as a first-class artifact that lives alongside code. Instead of burying intent inside prompts, scripts, or runtime state, TTE makes sequencing, constraints, and boundaries visible in files that can be reviewed, versioned, and evolved.

For engineers, TTE enables:
- Git-native, diff-friendly workflow definitions
- Clear separation between design, execution, and evaluation
- Safer integration of AI into existing engineering practices
- Reduced ambiguity when humans and agents collaborate

TTE fits naturally into repositories, CI systems, and engineering review culture.

## Researchers

Researchers care deeply about method, provenance, and reproducibility.

TTE supports research workflows by making experimental structure explicit and durable. Hypotheses, steps, assumptions, and decision points are captured as artifacts that persist beyond a single run or result.

For researchers, TTE enables:
- Reproducible AI-assisted experiments
- Clear separation of exploration, analysis, and synthesis
- Reduced risk of AI-driven method drift
- A workflow record that can be audited, shared, and rerun

TTE functions like a lab notebook that both humans and AI systems can follow.

## Makers

Makers work through iteration, experimentation, and partial success.

TTE helps makers externalize what is often held implicitly: what they are trying to build, why a step exists, and what comes next. This reduces context loss between sessions and makes projects easier to resume, modify, or share.

For makers, TTE enables:
- Memory across build iterations
- Clear checkpoints between experimentation phases
- Easier collaboration and handoff
- Less reliance on fragile, unwritten context

TTE supports creative tinkering without imposing heavy tooling.

## Storytellers

Storytellers work in phases where intent and continuity matter more than raw output.

TTE helps storytellers structure creative workflows without constraining creativity. Worldbuilding, drafting, revision, and canon decisions can be separated into clear steps that preserve intent across time and tool use.

For storytellers, TTE enables:
- Narrative continuity across drafts and sessions
- Clear separation between exploration and canon
- Consistent collaboration with AI tools
- Reduced loss of thematic or structural intent

TTE acts as a continuity and intent scaffold rather than a creative constraint.

## A Shared Principle

Across all audiences, TTE supports the same core idea:

**Make workflow structure explicit so humans and AI systems spend less effort guessing intent and more effort doing useful work.**
