## Entries
- Step: 1
- Role: Bootstrap
- Summary: Interpreted the prompt, proposed team composition, objectives, and plan adjustments; created cycle-01 BOOTSTRAP deliverable.
- Decisions: Emphasized print-safe STL deliverable, added optional render preview and mesh QA recommendation.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Storyteller
- Step: 2
- Role: Storyteller
- Summary: Defined the Marioland-inspired bonsai narrative, visual language, and texture guidance.
- Decisions: Emphasized chunky silhouettes, fused leaf masses, and shallow textures for printability.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: SVG engineer (optional)
- Step: 3
- Role: SVG engineer
- Summary: Confirmed SVG engineering is not required for this STL-focused cycle and documented minimal notes.
- Decisions: Proceeded without SVG pipeline steps.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Orchestrator
- Step: 4
- Role: Orchestrator
- Summary: Updated PLAN.md with concrete deliverable paths and advanced the cycle to core production.
- Decisions: Set expected STL and documentation filenames for cycle-01 assets.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Core worker
- Step: 5
- Role: Core worker
- Summary: Generated a voxel-based bonsai STL and documented the model and print notes.
- Decisions: Used voxel union to guarantee a watertight mesh and blocky Marioland-like texture.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Reviewer
- Step: 6
- Role: Reviewer
- Summary: Reviewed the STL and documentation; no blocking issues found.
- Decisions: Recommended optional smoothing and external mesh validation.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Delivery packager
- Step: 7
- Role: Delivery packager
- Summary: Packaged cycle-01 assets, added companion logo, and updated releases.
- Decisions: Included logo as a companion PNG asset for STL-only delivery.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Retrospective
- Step: 8
- Role: Retrospective
- Summary: Added post-delivery retrospective notes and marked cycle-01 as complete in releases.
- Decisions: Recommended mesh validation and smoothing options for future cycles.
- Open questions: Awaiting human selection of the next-cycle prompt.
- Next step: Human feedback
- Step: 1 (cycle-02)
- Role: Bootstrap
- Summary: Interpreted the banner animation prompt and created cycle-02 bootstrap deliverable.
- Decisions: Planned for a self-contained HTML animation if MP4/GIF encoding is unavailable.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Storyteller
- Step: 2 (cycle-02)
- Role: Storyteller
- Summary: Defined the cinematic banner tone, lighting, and motion beats.
- Decisions: Chose a slow, gallery-like turntable with soft gradients and subtle highlights.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: SVG engineer (optional)
- Step: 3 (cycle-02)
- Role: SVG engineer
- Summary: Confirmed SVG engineering is not required for the STL-based animation output.
- Decisions: Proceeded without SVG pipeline steps.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Orchestrator
- Step: 4 (cycle-02)
- Role: Orchestrator
- Summary: Updated PLAN.md with concrete deliverable paths for the banner animation assets.
- Decisions: Set HTML/CSS/JS deliverables plus ANIMATION.md for notes.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Core worker
