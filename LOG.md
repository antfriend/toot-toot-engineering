# LOG

## Entries
- Step: 1
- Role: Bootstrap
- Summary: Interpreted the cycle-01 prompt, proposed team composition, objectives, constraints, and plan adjustments; captured feasibility notes and next-cycle prompts in `deliverables/cycle-01/BOOTSTRAP.md`.
- Decisions: Note DB file absent; recommend early decision gate for storyboard storage; plan to use `time-foundry.svg` for aspect ratio and bookends if feasible.
- Open questions: Should a new `MyMentalPalaceDB.db` be created or should the storyboard live in Markdown?
- Next step: Storyteller
- Step: 2
- Role: Storyteller
- Summary: Defined the narrative spine, metaphors, audience framing, and a 24-slide timing map for a 4-minute onboarding slideshow in `deliverables/cycle-01/STORYTELLER.md`.
- Decisions: Use a 24-slide cadence at 10 seconds each and a foundry/factory metaphor anchored to `time-foundry.svg`.
- Open questions: Confirm whether to include a concrete example artifact on-screen beyond the slideshow itself.
- Next step: SVG engineer
- Step: 3
- Role: SVG engineer
- Summary: Documented SVG constraints, layout grid, slide system, and export guidance for the 1600x600 slideshow in `deliverables/cycle-01/SVG_ENGINEER.md`.
- Decisions: Use `time-foundry.svg` as opening/closing scenes; prefer static exports over animations for video rendering reliability.
- Open questions: Should the slideshow be a single SVG with layered slides or multiple per-slide SVG files?
- Next step: Orchestrator
- Step: 4
- Role: Orchestrator
- Summary: Updated `PLAN.md` to reflect completed steps and to specify orchestrator deliverables; confirmed `AGENTS.md` and `LOG.md` conventions remain in force.
- Decisions: Keep existing role definitions; move the cycle to the Core worker step.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Core worker
- Step: 5
- Role: Core worker
- Summary: Built the 24-slide SVG slideshow and aligned monologue script; replaced the MyMentalPalaceDB sample with the slideshow storyboard.
- Decisions: Use a single SVG with layered slide groups and `time-foundry.svg` as opening/closing scene; keep 10-second slide cadence.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Reviewer
- Step: 6
- Role: Reviewer
- Summary: Reviewed slideshow, monologue, and storyboard for requirements alignment and export risks; logged findings in `deliverables/cycle-01/REVIEW.md`.
- Decisions: Flagged external logo references, `time-foundry.svg` reuse ambiguity, and DB storage feasibility for resolution during delivery packaging.
- Open questions: Should the logo be embedded and should a real `MyMentalPalaceDB.db` be created?
- Next step: Delivery packager
- Step: 7
- Role: Delivery packager
- Summary: Packaged final cycle assets, documented export notes, and updated releases; renamed cycle-only files to include `-cycle` suffix.
- Decisions: Keep external logo references and note embedding recommendation; document Markdown as the storyboard fallback for the missing DB file.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Retrospective
