# PLAN

## Current cycle
- cycle-01

## Current step
- [x] Step 1 (cycle-01): Bootstrap interprets the prompt, proposes team composition, and recommends plan adjustments. (`deliverables/cycle-01/BOOTSTRAP.md`)
- [x] Step 2 (cycle-01): Storyteller refines the central story or creative thread and elevates narrative excellence. (`deliverables/cycle-01/STORYTELLER.md`)
- [x] Step 3 (cycle-01): (Optional) SVG engineer documents SVG constraints and coordinates with Storyteller when the prompt centers on SVG output. (`deliverables/cycle-01/SVG_ENGINEER.md`)
- [x] Step 4 (cycle-01): Orchestrator bootstraps the repo and sets the plan (cycle-01).
- [x] Step 5 (cycle-01): Core worker produces primary solution assets (cycle-01). Outputs:
  - `deliverables/cycle-01/gearbox.scad`
  - `deliverables/cycle-01/SOLUTION.md`
- [x] Step 6 (cycle-01): Reviewer checks for correctness and gaps (cycle-01). (`deliverables/cycle-01/REVIEW.md`)
- [x] Step 7 (cycle-01): Delivery packager assembles final assets and export notes (cycle-01). (`deliverables/cycle-01/DELIVERY.md`, updates `RELEASES.md`)
- [x] Step 8 (cycle-01): Retrospective recommends role/plan changes; Bootstrap updates `deliverables/cycle-01/BOOTSTRAP.md` with recommendations and offers to reset the plan for a new prompt grounded in the latest deliveries.

## Inputs for this cycle
- `README.md` (cycle-01 prompt source)
- `WHAT.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CHECKLIST.md`
- `RELEASES.md`
- `MORTAL-ENGINES-FRAMEWORK-RELEASES.md`

## Critical path
- [x] 1. Bootstrap interprets the prompt, proposes team composition, and recommends plan adjustments. (`deliverables/cycle-01/BOOTSTRAP.md`)
- [x] 2. Storyteller refines the central story or creative thread and elevates narrative excellence. (`deliverables/cycle-01/STORYTELLER.md`)
- [x] 3. (Optional) SVG engineer documents SVG constraints and coordinates with Storyteller when the prompt centers on SVG output. (`deliverables/cycle-01/SVG_ENGINEER.md`)
- [x] 4. Orchestrator bootstraps the repo and sets the plan (cycle-01).
- [x] 5. Core worker produces primary solution assets (cycle-01). Expected outputs:
  - `deliverables/cycle-01/gearbox.scad`
  - `deliverables/cycle-01/SOLUTION.md`
- [x] 6. Reviewer checks for correctness and gaps (cycle-01). (`deliverables/cycle-01/REVIEW.md`)
- [x] 7. Delivery packager assembles final assets and export notes (cycle-01). (`deliverables/cycle-01/DELIVERY.md`, updates `RELEASES.md`)
- [x] 8. Retrospective recommends role/plan changes to prevent issues or improve outcomes; Bootstrap offers to implement the recommendations and reset the plan with a new prompt that builds on the latest deliveries (cycle-01).
