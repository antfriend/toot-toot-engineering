# PLAN

## Current cycle
- cycle-04

## Current step
- [x] Step 8 (cycle-04): Retrospective recommends role/plan changes to prevent issues or improve outcomes; Bootstrap offers to implement the recommendations and reset the plan with a new prompt that builds on the latest deliveries (cycle-04). (`deliverables/cycle-04/BOOTSTRAP.md`)

## Inputs for this cycle
- `deliverables/cycle-04/BOOTSTRAP.md` (cycle-04 prompt source)
- `WHAT.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CHECKLIST.md`
- `RELEASES.md`
- `MORTAL-ENGINES-FRAMEWORK-RELEASES.md`

## Critical path
- [x] 1. Bootstrap interprets the prompt, proposes team composition, and recommends plan adjustments. (`deliverables/cycle-04/BOOTSTRAP.md`)
- [x] 2. Storyteller refines the central story or creative thread and elevates narrative excellence. (`deliverables/cycle-04/STORYTELLER.md`)
- [x] 3. Orchestrator bootstraps the repo and sets the plan (cycle-04). (`PLAN.md`, `LOG.md`)
- [x] 4. Image producer generates process map imagery assets (cycle-04). (`deliverables/cycle-04/IMAGE_ASSETS.md`, `deliverables/cycle-04/assets/`)
- [x] 5. Core worker produces primary solution assets (cycle-04). (`deliverables/cycle-04/SOLUTION.md`)
- [x] 6. Reviewer checks for correctness and gaps (cycle-04). (`deliverables/cycle-04/REVIEW.md`)
- [x] 7. Delivery packager assembles final assets and export notes (cycle-04). (`deliverables/cycle-04/DELIVERY.md`)
- [x] 8. Retrospective recommends role/plan changes to prevent issues or improve outcomes; Bootstrap offers to implement the recommendations and reset the plan with a new prompt that builds on the latest deliveries (cycle-04). (`deliverables/cycle-04/BOOTSTRAP.md`)
