# PLAN

## Current cycle
- cycle-01

## Current step
- [ ] Cycle end: Await human feedback and selection of next-cycle prompt (choose 1 of the 3 prompts in `deliverables/cycle-01/BOOTSTRAP.md`).

## Inputs for this cycle
- `README.md` (cycle-01 prompt source)
- `TTE_PROMPT.md`
- `WHAT.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CHECKLIST.md`
- `RELEASES.md`
- `LOG.md`
- `RFCs/` (for technical clarifications)

## Critical path
- [x] 1. Bootstrap interprets the prompt, proposes team composition, and recommends plan adjustments. (`deliverables/cycle-01/BOOTSTRAP.md`)
- [x] 2. Storyteller refines the central story or creative thread and elevates narrative excellence. (`deliverables/cycle-01/STORYTELLER.md`)
- [x] 3. Orchestrator bootstraps the repo and sets the plan (cycle-01). (`deliverables/cycle-01/ORCHESTRATOR.md`, `deliverables/cycle-01/CONFIG.md`)
- [x] 4. Core worker produces primary solution assets (cycle-01): Python gateway pipeline + simulator + DB writer + offline monitor + topic map. (generated outputs in `deliverables/cycle-01/generated/`)
- [x] 5. Reviewer checks for correctness and gaps (cycle-01). (`deliverables/cycle-01/REVIEW.md`)
- [x] 6. Delivery packager assembles final assets and export notes (cycle-01). (`deliverables/cycle-01/DELIVERY.md`, `RELEASES.md` updated)
- [x] 7. Retrospective recommends role/plan changes to prevent issues or improve outcomes; Bootstrap offers to implement the recommendations and reset the plan with a new prompt grounded in the latest deliveries (cycle-01). (`deliverables/cycle-01/RETROSPECTIVE.md`)
