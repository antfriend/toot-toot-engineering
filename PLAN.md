# PLAN

## Current cycle
- cycle-02

## Current step
- [ ] (cycle complete)

## Inputs for this cycle
- `deliverables/cycle-01/DELIVERY.md` (previous cycle output)
- `deliverables/cycle-02/BOOTSTRAP.md` (cycle-02 prompt source)
- `WHAT.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CHECKLIST.md`
- `RELEASES.md`
- `LOG.md`

## Critical path
- [x] 1. Bootstrap interprets the prompt, proposes team composition, and recommends plan adjustments. (`deliverables/cycle-02/BOOTSTRAP.md`)
- [x] 2. Storyteller refines the central story or creative thread and elevates narrative excellence. (`deliverables/cycle-02/STORYTELLER.md`)
- [x] 3. (Optional) SVG engineer documents SVG constraints and coordinates with Storyteller when the prompt centers on SVG output. (`deliverables/cycle-02/SVG_ENGINEER.md`) (skip: prompt is audio-centric)
- [x] 4. Orchestrator bootstraps the repo and sets the plan (cycle-02). Created cycle audio pipeline scaffolding and build notes (`deliverables/cycle-02/BUILD.md`, `deliverables/cycle-02/src/`, `deliverables/cycle-02/output/`).
- [x] 5. Core worker produces primary solution assets (cycle-02). Rendered WAV outputs and dependency-free renderer (`deliverables/cycle-02/output/toot-toot-engineering.wav`, `deliverables/cycle-02/src/render_tte.py`).
- [x] 6. Reviewer checks for correctness and gaps (cycle-02). (`deliverables/cycle-02/REVIEW.md`)
- [x] 7. Delivery packager assembles final assets and export notes (cycle-02). (`deliverables/cycle-02/DELIVERY.md`)
- [x] 8. Retrospective recommends role/plan changes to prevent issues or improve outcomes; Bootstrap offers to implement the recommendations and reset the plan with a new prompt that builds on the latest deliveries (cycle-02). (updated `deliverables/cycle-02/BOOTSTRAP.md`)
