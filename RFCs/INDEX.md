# RFC Index

This index lists RFCs included in the TTE 1.0 bundle.

**Compressed form:** [rfc.ttdb.md](rfc.ttdb.md) is the semantic compression of this
corpus — a conformant TTDB with one record per RFC (normative gist + `depends_on`
edge graph + `[ew]` status weights) and a `lat 98` belief lane recording where
implemented reality diverges from spec text. Each record's `src:` line is its
deterministic expansion target (TTN-RFC-0004 applied to the corpus itself).


## TTDB (Toot-Toot Database)
- [TTDB-RFC-0001-File-Format.md](TTDB-RFC-0001-File-Format.md): File Format and Sections
- [TTDB-RFC-0002-Cursor-Semantics.md](TTDB-RFC-0002-Cursor-Semantics.md): Cursor Semantics and Selection Rules
- [TTDB-RFC-0003-Typed-Edges.md](TTDB-RFC-0003-Typed-Edges.md): Typed Edge Semantics — **v1.1** adds §7: symmetric types, and `opposes` for semantic polarity (distinct from the epistemic `contradicts`; under `opposes` both endpoints may be true). §§1–6 unchanged, all v1.0 files remain valid
- [TTDB-RFC-0004-Event-ID-and-Collision.md](TTDB-RFC-0004-Event-ID-and-Collision.md): Event ID Assignment and Collision Handling
- [TTDB-RFC-0005-Epistemic-Weight.md](TTDB-RFC-0005-Epistemic-Weight.md): Toot-Bit Epistemic Weight (TBEW) — optional [ew] block for confidence, revision, salience, and recency metadata
- [TTDB-RFC-0006-Experiential-Perception-as-Synthetic-Model.md](TTDB-RFC-0006-Experiential-Perception-as-Synthetic-Model.md): Experiential Perception as Synthetic Model (Locus framework foundation)
- [TTDB-RFC-0007-Locus-Point-and-Dream-Cycle.md](TTDB-RFC-0007-Locus-Point-and-Dream-Cycle.md): Locus Point and Dream Cycle — episodic-to-semantic memory consolidation via two-phase offline graph traversal; `@BELIEF:` namespace; graph compression; multi-agent belief propagation
- [TTDB-RFC-0008-Narrative-Metamorphosis.md](TTDB-RFC-0008-Narrative-Metamorphosis.md): Narrative Metamorphosis — story-seeded life-stage transition from game-solving larva to orchestrating imago; `@IMAGO:seed` and `@META:state` namespaces; instar sequencing; eclosion predicate; ARC Prize 2026 worked example
- [TTDB-RFC-0009-Counter-Story-and-Narrative-Morphospace.md](TTDB-RFC-0009-Counter-Story-and-Narrative-Morphospace.md): Counter-Story and Narrative Morphospace — generalizes TTDB-RFC-0008's scene-as-instar to the claim that **pattern (morphospace) targets are stored as traversal order, and the ending is the stopping condition**; and that a **counter-story** (an account from a genuinely divergent umwelt) changes the *topology* of a store's ignorance while a corroborating account only changes its *volume*. Defines the residual high-EPS coordinate set `R(S,θ)` and Jaccard-distance metric contract (the instrument that **must not be a dashboard**), the paired narrative/assertional store construction at matched toot-bits, the heterogeneity gate, the fleet's ablatable modality classes (Cardputer acoustic+motion / Heltec V4 link / T-Deck GNSS), and the normative ban on substituting die temperature for ambient. (Proposed; **nothing run on hardware**, and its EXP-01 gate is also unrun; companion `replicate/TTX-0004-counter-story.md`; builds on TTDB-RFC-0005/-0006/-0007/-0008, relates to TTN-RFC-0011)

- [TTN-RFC-0010-Fleet-Pulse.md](TTN-RFC-0010-Fleet-Pulse.md): Fleet Pulse — self-synchronizing ~1 Hz heartbeat and the **band time-base**: `PULSE` (type 13) chart beacon, peer-seeded pulse clock (`gPulseOffsetMs`), first-up-conducts / lowest-id-keeps election with `era` handoff, drift-paced beacons (zero per-beat traffic), ±50 ms as musical **swing**, and a `Part`/instrument split for parts & melodies. K10 toots + RGB; **V4s get an LED pulse**. (Implemented ✅ end-to-end on-device 2026-06-26 → 2026-07-06, incl. parts/melodies and the 120 BPM duet; sibling of Phase 2.5; builds on TTN-RFC-0008)
- [TTN-RFC-0011-Semantic-Positioning.md](TTN-RFC-0011-Semantic-Positioning.md): Semantic Positioning — the formal/normative half of the **primary hypothesis** (`ttn-semantic-positioning.md`): position is *recoverable from* umwelt overlap, not merely *assigned*. States the SPH, the confidence-weighted overlap measure `Ω(i,j)` (over TBEW `conf`/`sal`), the MDS/spring-relaxation embedding (shape for free; one anchor fixes it to Earth), Semantic Odometry, the two failure modes (spacetime entanglement §8.1 — the blocking open problem; modal incommensurability §8.2), and a zero-cost RSSI-vs-`Ω` validation procedure for the V4-A/B/C spine.

## ARC (ARC-AGI-3 Competition Agent)

The companion-arc agent for the ARC Prize 2026 ARC-AGI-3 competition. A general
count-based explorer (the additive floor) with an optional recognition-gated,
abortable per-instance solver layer over it.

## A32 (ESP32 Autonomous Device Framework)

Agent 32 is a framework for building autonomous ESP32 devices using the Toot-Toot Database (TTDB) as an onboard, static knowledge base. No cloud LLMs. No neural inference. Just deterministic graph-based reasoning on a $5 microcontroller.
