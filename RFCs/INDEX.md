# RFC Index

This index lists RFCs included in the TTE 1.0 bundle.

**Compressed form:** [rfc.ttdb.md](rfc.ttdb.md) is the semantic compression of this
corpus — a conformant TTDB with one record per RFC (normative gist + `depends_on`
edge graph + `[ew]` status weights) and a `lat 98` belief lane recording where
implemented reality diverges from spec text. Each record's `src:` line is its
deterministic expansion target (TTN-RFC-0004 applied to the corpus itself).

States the SPH, the confidence-weighted overlap measure `Ω(i,j)` (over TBEW `conf`/`sal`), the MDS/spring-relaxation embedding (shape for free; one anchor fixes it to Earth), Semantic Odometry, the two failure modes (spacetime entanglement §8.1 — the blocking open problem; modal incommensurability §8.2), and a zero-cost RSSI-vs-`Ω` validation procedure for the V4-A/B/C spine.

## TTG (Toot Toot Grammar)

A person's own words as a question-answering store, where the file is the grammar: every
grammar rule, word list and reply phrase lives in one TTDB, and the runtime that reads it
holds no natural-language word. 1.0, stable; the reference runtime is
[personal_grimoire](../personal_grimoire/index.html), whose tests check these RFCs against it.

- [TTG-RFC-0001-Grammar-in-the-Store.md](TTG-RFC-0001-Grammar-in-the-Store.md): Grammar in the Store — the `ttdb-grammar` and `ttdb-sphere` blocks, the eight grammar kinds, the embedding surface, several languages in one store, and the **runtime contract**: no natural-language word or reply phrase in the interpreter
- [TTG-RFC-0002-Semantic-Percepts.md](TTG-RFC-0002-Semantic-Percepts.md): Semantic Percepts, Episodes and Terms — the percept line (subject, vector, object, polarity, quantifier), episode and term records, placement on the grammar sphere, byte-stable write-back
- [TTG-RFC-0003-Beliefs-Reasoning-Response.md](TTG-RFC-0003-Beliefs-Reasoning-Response.md): Beliefs, Vector Reasoning and Grounded Response — consolidation over episodes, vector algebra, Datalog-style rules, inference with specificity, and replies whose grounds are said, inferred, contested or superseded, never printed alike
- [TTG-RFC-0004-Time-and-the-Fleet.md](TTG-RFC-0004-Time-and-the-Fleet.md): Time — the order of sayings without a clock, `exclusive` vectors whose later sayings retire earlier ones, the `superseded` ground (§2–3 stable); and, proposed, how a fleet orders sayings on a shared pulse (§4, builds on TTN-RFC-0010)
- [TTG-RFC-0005-Shapes-and-Amendments.md](TTG-RFC-0005-Shapes-and-Amendments.md): Shapes and Amendments — a clause as any alternating run of nounish and verbish segments; relative and stance clauses; held sayings, never believed, including both readings of a sentence the grammar reads two ways, named so the owner can choose; the shape notation the owner overrules a reading with; amendments kept beside the episode, and re-readings that report a grammar change without writing until the owner takes them

## ARC (ARC-AGI-3 Competition Agent)

The companion-arc agent for the ARC Prize 2026 ARC-AGI-3 competition. A general
count-based explorer (the additive floor) with an optional recognition-gated,
abortable per-instance solver layer over it.

## A32 (ESP32 Autonomous Device Framework)

Agent 32 is a framework for building autonomous ESP32 devices using the Toot-Toot Database (TTDB) as an onboard, static knowledge base. No cloud LLMs. No neural inference. Just deterministic graph-based reasoning on a $5 microcontroller.
