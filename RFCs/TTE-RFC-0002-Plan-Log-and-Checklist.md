This RFC defines required content for `PLAN.md`, `LOG.md`, and checklists.

---

## 1. PLAN.md
`PLAN.md` MUST include:
- Step list with role ownership
- Deliverables path for each step
- Current step indicator
- Inputs for this cycle list of allowed references

---

## 2. LOG.md
`LOG.md` MUST include entries that follow the template:

The checklist is expected to be in `CHECKLIST.md` unless otherwise specified.
