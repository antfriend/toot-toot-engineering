# TTE-RFC-0003
## Definition of Done and Release Packaging
### Version 1.0

Status: Draft

This RFC defines completion requirements and release packaging rules.

---

## 1. Definition of Done
A cycle is done only when primary deliverables exist and are validated.
For document-style outputs, this includes:
- A print-ready PDF in the cycle output
- Source assets and build notes
- Review confirmation of print specs and narrative coherence

---

## 2. Release Packaging
- `RELEASES.md` MUST be updated with cycle deliverables.
- Delivery notes MUST be included in `deliverables/cycle-XX/DELIVERY.md`.

---

## 3. Quality Bar
- Factual claims include sources when relevant.
- Third-party assets include owner, status, and usage constraints.
