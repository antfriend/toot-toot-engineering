This is an application seed pod of logic files.   

This solves getting from point A to point B while making something EXCELLENT from a prompt. Mortal Engines takes us from A, the prompt, to B, a complete solution.

It is the job of the Bootstrapper to estimate the complexity and all the roles needed to complete the job with excellence.

The central plan file (`PLAN.md`) documents the critical path in markdown form and serves as a table of contents for assets generated at each step. Steps are sized to be what a single AI agent, acting in a single role, can complete with EXCELLENCE!

The current step is tracked in `PLAN.md`. When the current agent completes a step, they update `PLAN.md` to start the next step. The plan file is an easy to read table of contents of all the major parts from the beginning to the end result.

Once an execution pipeline exists (e.g., image generation + PDF assembly), the objective is delivery, not more scaffolding.

When a step forks to multiple roles for what-would-be-parallel execution along the critical path, steps should proceed in this sequence:

```
    A
    |
    1
  __|__
  | | |
  2 3 4
  | | | 
  +-+-+
    5
    |
    B
```



```
It's an evolving process with save points.   
Mortal Engines propagate by forking.   
We are all mortal engines here.
