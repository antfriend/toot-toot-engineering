# Cycle 01 Bootstrap

## Prompt
Create a beautiful, colorful, animated Toot Toot Engineering logo in SVG with CSS. Use the Mortal Engines framework for inspiration and include as much detail and metaphoric imagery as we can possibly do.

## Interpretation
We are building a logo that feels like a living machine: gears, whistles, rails, and luminous energy. The piece should be expressive and animated, conveying a creative factory that produces excellence.

## Objectives
- Produce a polished animated SVG logo with CSS-driven motion.
- Capture the Mortal Engines metaphor: interlocking systems, momentum, and crafted detail.
- Document the deliverable clearly so it can be reused or embedded.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap: prompt interpretation and team shape.
- Storyteller: elevate the narrative thread and identify the magic moments.
- Orchestrator: confirm plan structure, roles, and sequencing.
- Core worker: build the SVG and supporting documentation.
- Reviewer: verify fidelity to prompt and check for gaps.
- Delivery packager: assemble deliverables and update release notes.
- Retrospective: record improvements for the next cycle.

## Plan adjustments
- Insert Storyteller early to refine the creative thread before production.
- Emphasize animated SVG with layered gradients and motion cues.

## Risks
- Animation overload could hurt readability at small sizes.
- External fonts may render inconsistently across hosts.

## Success criteria
- SVG loads in a browser and animates without external assets.
- Visual story feels industrial, playful, and excellent.
- Deliverables include clear documentation and release tracking.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one)
1. Create a set of three logo lockups (horizontal, stacked, icon-only) using the same animated SVG visual language, with export notes.
2. Build a short motion spec and storyboard that explains how the Mortal Engines workflow could be animated in a 10-second intro.
3. Design a printable poster that showcases the Mortal Engines workflow as an infographic with strong typographic hierarchy.

## Retrospective recommendations
- Add a brief Storyteller checklist to reinforce narrative alignment in early steps.
- Consider a lightweight animation review pass for SVG-heavy deliverables.

## Offer to implement
If you pick a next-cycle prompt, I can update `PLAN.md` to start cycle-02 and carry the improvements forward.
