# BOOTSTRAP

## Prompt
Create a beautiful, richly detailed SVG file of a famous stained glass window.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap
- Storyteller
- SVG engineer
- Orchestrator
- Core worker
- Reviewer
- Delivery packager
- Retrospective

## Objectives
- Produce a single SVG capturing a famous stained glass window with rich detail, layered glass leadwork, and color depth.
- Ensure the SVG is self-contained with a clear viewBox, no external assets, and renderable in modern browsers.
- Provide build notes and metadata for review and delivery packaging.

## Recommended plan adjustments
- Define core worker outputs: `deliverables/cycle-01/stained-glass.svg` and `deliverables/cycle-01/SOLUTION.md` with build notes.
- Treat the SVG engineer step as required for this cycle since the prompt is SVG-centered.
- Add explicit SVG validation checks during review: structure, viewBox, no external refs, and render sanity.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one)
1. Build on the cycle-01 SVG by adding realistic lighting effects with CSS (glow, bloom, directional light) and a short lighting notes section.
2. Create a companion SVG of the same window at dusk with a shifted palette, plus a short comparison note.
3. Build a print-ready poster layout that frames the finished stained glass SVG with title and credits.

## Retrospective recommendations
- Add a lightweight SVG validation checklist to reduce prompt-alignment misses.
- Capture the named-window inspiration in the core worker step to avoid ambiguity.
- Include CSS-based lighting experiments in the next cycle to enrich visual realism.

Bootstrap can implement these recommendations after you select a cycle-02 prompt.
