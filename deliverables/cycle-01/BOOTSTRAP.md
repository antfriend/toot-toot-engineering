# BOOTSTRAP (cycle-01)

## Prompt interpretation
Create a wide, cinematic, high-density animated SVG mural that depicts a "time foundry": molten timelines pour into gears that forge memories. The scene needs deep environmental storytelling with layered depth, glow, flow, and motion. The words "Toot Toot Engineering" float in the foreground, large, dark, and central.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap: interpret prompt, propose team and adjustments.
- Storyteller: clarify narrative beats and visual motifs for the foundry.
- SVG engineer: define SVG animation constraints, layering strategy, and performance guardrails.
- Orchestrator: formalize the plan and assets, keep workflow aligned.
- Core worker: build the animated SVG mural and supporting notes/assets.
- Reviewer: verify narrative clarity, animation correctness, and prompt fidelity.
- Delivery packager: assemble final assets and release notes, include logo usage.
- Retrospective: capture process improvements for the next cycle.

## High-level objectives
- Translate the "time foundry" concept into a clear, cinematic SVG composition.
- Deliver multi-layered depth with glowing molten flows and moving gear mechanics.
- Preserve readable, dominant "Toot Toot Engineering" type in the foreground.
- Keep SVG performant and self-contained with defined animation timing.

## Strategic plan adjustments
- Treat SVG engineer as required (not optional) due to animation/performance risks.
- Add a lightweight animation timing table in the core worker deliverable to aid review.
- Ensure delivery packaging includes a small Toot Toot Engineering logo asset reference.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one)
1) Create a companion static poster variant (SVG + PNG export notes) that simplifies motion into graphic glow trails while keeping the same "time foundry" story.
2) Build a "making-of" SVG diagram that breaks the mural into labeled depth layers and animation passes for educational use.
3) Create a short looping banner (wide, low-height) that distills the foundry into 2-3 animated elements and the logo lockup.

## Retrospective (early recommendation)
To prevent animation bottlenecks, add an explicit "animation QA checklist" step before review and require a quick performance sanity check (file size + animation count). If you want, I can implement these changes after this cycle and reset the plan with the next-cycle prompt you choose.

## Retrospective update
- The SVG pipeline worked smoothly; the most helpful guardrail was the explicit animation timing table.
- Recommended plan change: insert a short "animation QA checklist" step before the reviewer, covering SMIL support risks, file size, and animation count.
- Optional improvement: add a lightweight "SVG optimization pass" step if future cycles target very dense scenes.
- Offer: I can implement these changes now and reset the plan using the next-cycle prompt you select.
