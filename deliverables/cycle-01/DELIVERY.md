# DELIVERY

## Status
Complete for cycle-01.

## Primary artifacts
- `deliverables/cycle-01/stained-glass.svg`
- `deliverables/cycle-01/SOLUTION.md`

## Supporting artifacts
- `deliverables/cycle-01/BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `deliverables/cycle-01/STORYTELLER.md`
- `deliverables/cycle-01/SVG_ENGINEER.md`
- `deliverables/cycle-01/REVIEW.md`

## Notes
- SVG is self-contained and renders in modern browsers with gradients, leadwork, and subtle grain texture.
- Review flagged a prompt-alignment risk: the artwork is not explicitly tied to a named famous window.

## Suggested next step
Address the review note in the next cycle by adding lighting effects and explicitly tying the piece to a named window if required.
