# DELIVERY (cycle-01)

## Delivered files
- `deliverables/cycle-01/gearbox.scad` — source model (OpenSCAD)
- `deliverables/cycle-01/SOLUTION.md` — export + print + tuning notes
- `deliverables/cycle-01/REVIEW.md` — review notes and risks
- `deliverables/cycle-01/BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `deliverables/cycle-01/STORYTELLER.md`
- `deliverables/cycle-01/SVG_ENGINEER.md` (not required; included as explicit skip rationale)

## How to produce the STL locally
Open OpenSCAD → open `gearbox.scad` → **F6** → Export as STL.

## Logo inclusion
For this media (source + documentation), include the Toot Toot Engineering logo as a **companion asset** in the repo root:
- `toot-toot-logo.svg`
- `toot-toot-logo.png`

(An embedded logo in the 3D geometry is intentionally omitted for minimal mechanical risk.)

## Notes
- This is a minimal, print-in-place gearbox using simplified gear teeth; expect to tune `clearance` for your printer.
