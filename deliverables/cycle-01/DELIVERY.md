# DELIVERY (cycle-01)

## What was delivered
### Primary artifact
- `deliverables/cycle-01/HARDWARE_OPTIONS.md`

### Supporting artifacts
- `deliverables/cycle-01/BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `deliverables/cycle-01/STORYTELLER.md`
- `deliverables/cycle-01/ORCHESTRATOR.md`
- `deliverables/cycle-01/REVIEW.md`

## How to use this deliverable
- Start with the “Quick choices” section to pick either:
  - an all-in-one Meshtastic-ready board (fastest), or
  - a mix-and-match build (most flexible/cheapest).
- Then use the tables to pick radio + MCU + display + power.
- Finish by selecting a “reference build recipe” and adapting based on your region band and availability.

## Notes / constraints
- Prices are ballpark retail ranges (USD) as-of 2026-01.
- LoRa hardware must match your region band (US915/EU868/etc.).
- Meshtastic support is model/revision-specific; verify against Meshtastic hardware docs.

## Logo requirement
This cycle produced a markdown report (no embedded image). If you package this as a PDF or web page, include a small Toot Toot Engineering logo as an embedded image or companion asset derived from `toot-toot-logo.png`/`toot-toot-logo.svg`.

## Suggested next action
Pick one reference build and produce a follow-on build guide (wiring + firmware flashing + power/enclosure notes).
