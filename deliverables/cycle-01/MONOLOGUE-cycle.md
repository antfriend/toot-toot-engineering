# MONOLOGUE (cycle-01)

Length target: 4 minutes (about 540-600 words). Each block aligns to a 10 second slide.

01 (0:00-0:10)
Welcome to Toot Toot Engineering. This is a factory for reliable creative work. We start in the time foundry, where intent becomes artifacts.

02 (0:10-0:20)
The point is simple: make AI collaboration repeatable, readable, and calm. No secret tricks. Just a set of clear steps you can trust.

03 (0:20-0:30)
Here is the cycle: prompt, plan, roles, deliverables, review, delivery, retrospective. It is a loop that improves every time you run it.

04 (0:30-0:40)
Everything begins with a clear prompt in README.md. That prompt is the lantern for your team. It tells everyone what to build.

05 (0:40-0:50)
Work happens in cycles. Each cycle has a folder and a plan. Every step leaves a trace you can point to later.

06 (0:50-1:00)
PLAN.md is the press. It shows the critical path and the current step. One step, one role, one output, no guessing.

07 (1:00-1:10)
LOG.md is the memory. Each step records decisions, changes, and open questions. If it is not in the log, it does not count.

08 (1:10-1:20)
Roles take turns. Each role has a single purpose, so the work stays focused and easy to review.

09 (1:20-1:30)
Bootstrap reads the prompt, proposes the team, and adjusts the plan. It also flags risks before you get too deep.

10 (1:30-1:40)
Storyteller builds the narrative arc and pacing. It keeps the story human and clear, even for non coders.

11 (1:40-1:50)
SVG engineer defines layout rules, legibility, and export guidance so the visuals are clean and dependable.

12 (1:50-2:00)
Orchestrator keeps PLAN.md, AGENTS.md, and LOG.md honest. This role protects the system from drift.

13 (2:00-2:10)
Core worker builds the actual artifacts: slides, scripts, diagrams, code. This is where the work appears.

14 (2:10-2:20)
Reviewer hunts for gaps, risks, and missing tests. It does not ship until the work is solid.

15 (2:20-2:30)
Delivery packager assembles the final outputs and release notes, and makes sure the Toot Toot logo is included.

16 (2:30-2:40)
Retrospective improves the system for next time. It captures what to change so the next cycle is better.

17 (2:40-2:50)
All deliverables live in deliverables/cycle-XX. No hunting. No mystery. Everything is where you expect it.

18 (2:50-3:00)
The logo rule matters. Every final deliverable includes the Toot Toot mark, either embedded or as a companion asset.

19 (3:00-3:10)
As the human co-producer, you mostly approve guardrails. Feedback is needed at the end, not in the middle.

20 (3:10-3:20)
Starting is simple. Say go, proceed, or you got this. The system spins up and the cycle runs.

21 (3:20-3:30)
A typical output might be a slideshow and a monologue, ready to record and publish. The artifacts are ready when you are.

22 (3:30-3:40)
The quality bar is real. Cite sources when needed, and resolve every placeholder. Clarity is part of the deliverable.

23 (3:40-3:50)
Now we return to the foundry. The press stamps a finished artifact, and you can ship with confidence.

24 (3:50-4:00)
Start your first cycle today. Open README.md, light the lantern, and let the roles do their work.
