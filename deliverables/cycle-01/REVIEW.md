# Cycle 01 Review

## Checks
- Prompt alignment: yes, animated SVG logo with CSS is provided.
- Metaphoric imagery: gears, rails, steam, and glow communicate the factory narrative.
- Deliverables: SVG asset and documentation exist.

## Risks
- Some hosts may substitute fonts; layout should remain acceptable with fallbacks.
- Dense detail may reduce clarity at very small sizes.

## Required fixes
- None.
