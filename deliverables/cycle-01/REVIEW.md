# REVIEW

## Findings (ordered by severity)
1. The SVG does not clearly reference a specific famous stained glass window; it reads as a generic cathedral-style composition, which risks missing the prompt requirement. (`deliverables/cycle-01/stained-glass.svg`)

## Checks performed
- Verified SVG is self-contained with `viewBox`, inline defs, and no external assets.
- Confirmed gradients, filters, and IDs are defined locally.

## Risks and gaps
- The artistic direction may be acceptable, but if the requirement is interpreted strictly, a named window motif should be incorporated or documented.

## Recommendation
- Either adjust the artwork to mirror a specific famous window (e.g., Notre-Dame de Paris rose window or Chartres), or add a brief note in the solution explaining the intended inspiration.
