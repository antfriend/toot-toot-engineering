# SOLUTION (Cycle 01)

## Overview
This STL is a voxel-built, printable bonsai tree inspired by a playful Marioland-like aesthetic. The model is a single watertight mesh built from a union of voxel cubes for simplicity and print reliability.

## Model features
- Solid pot with tapered sides for stability.
- Curved trunk with two stylized branches.
- Puffy canopy clusters formed from overlapping spheres.
- Surface texture is inherently blocky from the voxel style.

## Print notes
- Recommended layer height: 0.2 mm or finer.
- No supports should be required for the canopy; branch overhangs are mild.
- Consider scaling up if you want a smoother surface finish.

## File
- `bonsai-marioland.stl` (ASCII STL)
