# STORYTELLER (cycle-01)

## Narrative spine
Toot Toot Engineering is a factory for making reliable creative work. We begin in the time-forge (time-foundry) to set the tone: molten intent, gears of roles, and a press that stamps deliverables. The story then walks the viewer through the cycle: prompt, plan, roles, outputs, review, delivery, and learning. The ending returns to the foundry with a completed artifact and a clear invitation to start a cycle.

## Audience framing
Aim for clarity over jargon; explain unfamiliar terms (cycle, plan, handoff) in plain language. Use a calm, confident voice that reassures non-vibe coders that this is just a structured checklist for creative work.

## Key metaphors
- Foundry = the workspace where ideas become artifacts.
- Gears = roles that take turns.
- Press = the plan that turns intent into deliverables.
- Lantern = the README prompt that lights the path.

## Slide cadence and timing
Target 24 slides at 10 seconds each (total 240 seconds).

## Voice notes for monologue
Keep sentences short and concrete. Invite the viewer to open README, PLAN.md, and LOG.md. Reassure that the process is just a set of steps anyone can follow. Close with a call to action.
