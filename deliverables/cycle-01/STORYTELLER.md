# STORYTELLER

## Cycle 01

### Narrative Refinement
The primary narrative is focused on developing a low-cost, wireless mesh networking device that leverages LoRa and Meshtastic technologies. This empowers users to build resilient networks in areas lacking conventional internet access.

The device will include:
- A compact, energy-efficient screen for user interaction.
- A microcontroller capable of supporting Circuit/Micro Python enabling flexibility in functionality.

This narrative builds on the need for affordable and accessible technology to bridge connectivity gaps, emphasizing innovation and practicality.
