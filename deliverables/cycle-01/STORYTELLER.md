# STORYTELLER (cycle-01)

## Narrative spine
The time foundry is an underground forge where molten timelines pour into massive gears. Each gear tooth stamps a memory into cooling metal, and the air shimmers with glowing steam. The viewer floats just above the factory floor, looking into a vast chamber where the machinery becomes a mythic engine of remembrance.

## Environmental storytelling beats
- Background: cavern walls and suspended scaffolds fade into a hazy glow, suggesting deep, layered depth.
- Midground: interlocking gear stacks, conveyor tracks, and memory molds pulse with heat.
- Foreground: a luminous stream of molten time crosses the scene toward the center forge.
- Foreground text: "Toot Toot Engineering" sits dark and large, like a forged plaque hovering above the flames.

## Motion and light cues
- Molten timelines flow in looping ribbons with shifting color and glow.
- Gears rotate at staggered speeds to imply mechanical complexity.
- Ambient glow pulses with slow breathing rhythm.
- Floating dust embers drift upward to add scale and atmosphere.

## Color and mood
- Core palette: deep charcoal, oxidized brass, ember orange, molten gold, and cool teal glows.
- Contrast: dark foreground text against high glow behind it for legibility.
- Cinematic width: emphasize long horizontal flow and layered parallax.
