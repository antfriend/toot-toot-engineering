# STORYTELLER (Cycle 01)

## Creative thread
A tiny, cheerful bonsai that looks like it grew in a whimsical Marioland plaza: chunky, soft-edged forms, playful proportions, and a silhouette that reads instantly from any angle. The tree should feel like a hero prop from a bright platformer world, with a touch of handcrafted charm in the bark and foliage.

## Visual language cues
- Rounded, toy-like shapes; avoid sharp, realistic twigs.
- Exaggerated root flare and trunk taper for readability.
- Leaf masses as clustered, puffy "clouds," not individual leaves.
- Pot with gentle curves and a subtle embossed trim.

## Surface texture notes
- Bark: shallow, rhythmic grooves and knots that catch light without creating fragile ridges.
- Leaves: soft, stippled texture or shallow dimples for a tactile feel.
- Pot: clean surface with minimal texturing to contrast the tree.

## Composition and silhouette
- Clear S-curve trunk with 2-3 major branches.
- One dominant leaf canopy with a secondary smaller cluster to balance.
- Keep negative space under the canopy so the bonsai reads from afar.

## Tone and narrative hook
This bonsai is a tiny guardian of a playful world. It looks like it belongs on a bright, pastel stone plaza with cheerful music in the air. The texture should feel "gamey" and friendly rather than naturalistic.

## Printability guidance for the 3D modeler
- Branches should stay stout; blend into the trunk smoothly.
- Leaf clusters should be fused into solid masses.
- Avoid deep crevices that trap support or create weak bridges.
