# STORYTELLER

## Core interpretation
A cathedral window is a story in light: the geometry of leadwork frames a cascade of color, and each pane is a jewel with its own texture and glow. The SVG should feel like sunlight passing through hand-cut glass, with rich saturation, subtle gradients, and a sense of depth created by layered pieces and ornamental borders.

## Narrative focus
- Choose a famous window and evoke its signature motifs (e.g., rose window tracery, lancet panels, or a central figure) without needing literal photorealism.
- Make the lead lines a visible structure that guides the eye, like calligraphy in black.
- Use layered color fields to suggest thickness, imperfections, and luminous variance.

## Visual beats
1. Bold outer frame and architectural stone border to anchor the composition.
2. Radial or vertical symmetry that immediately reads as a cathedral window.
3. Intricate inner medallions and filigree to convey craft and age.
4. Controlled gradients and highlights to simulate light transmission.

## Direction for SVG execution
- Favor clean vector geometry: arcs, circles, and path-based tracery.
- Use reusable patterns for lead lines and glass texture to maintain consistency.
- Keep the palette grounded in deep reds, cobalt blues, emerald greens, and amber accents for warmth.

## Success criteria
- The SVG feels ornate and reverent, with depth and glow.
- The composition reads as a famous stained glass window at a glance.
- The file is self-contained and renders crisply at multiple scales.
