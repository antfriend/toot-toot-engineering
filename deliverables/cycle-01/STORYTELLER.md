# STORYTELLER (cycle-01)

## Creative throughline
A slow, dignified reveal of Earth in deep space, with a cinematic banner that feels like a title card at the start of a grand adventure. The mood is calm, awe-filled, and optimistic.

## Visual direction
- Background: deep-space gradient with subtle starfield and a faint vignette.
- Earth: crisp limb lighting, slow rotation, gentle cloud shimmer.
- Banner: wide and centered, with a cinematic title treatment and soft glow.
- Palette: deep navy/black space, cool blues/teals for Earth, warm gold/cream for the banner text.

## Motion notes
- Loop length: ~4–6 seconds, seamless.
- Rotation: slow, steady, no wobble.
- Optional: subtle parallax drift of background stars for depth.

## Typography and banner treatment
- Text: "Hello World!" in a bold, cinematic serif or high-contrast display style.
- Treatment: slight bevel or emboss effect, soft outer glow, minimal shadow.
- Placement: center of frame, slightly above the Earth’s equator line for balance.

## Composition targets
- Aspect ratio: prefer 2.39:1 for cinematic scope; 16:9 acceptable fallback.
- Safe area: keep text within inner 70% width and 60% height for legibility.
- Logo: small Toot Toot Engineering logo tucked in a corner or below the banner, subtle but visible.

## Deliverable notes
- Ensure GIF loop is seamless and text is legible at final size.
- Keep the banner design consistent between static banner and animated GIF.
