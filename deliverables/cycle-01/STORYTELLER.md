# Cycle 01 Storyteller

## Story thesis
Toot Toot Engineering is a living workshop: a playful engine that turns ideas into polished artifacts. The logo should feel like a miniature factory in motion, with a joyful whistle and precise mechanics.

## Magic moments
- The gears visibly turn, implying a working machine.
- Steam and glow accents hint at energy and momentum.
- The rails arc under the logo, suggesting forward movement.

## Visual narrative beats
- Outer ring: a halo of craft and continuity.
- Central gears: collaboration and interlocking roles.
- Whistle + steam: the signature "toot toot" moment.
- Typography: bold, confident, and slightly industrial.

## Director notes
- Keep the animation elegant and readable at a glance.
- Prioritize contrast so the text remains legible over motion.
- If needed, add a slow ambient pulse to unify the scene.

## Requests to the Orchestrator
- No additional roles needed for this cycle.
- Ensure deliverables document how to reuse the SVG.
