# STORYTELLER (cycle-01)

## Creative intent (what “good” sounds like)
A short, punchy **audio tag** that feels like an industrial station announcement: **clean and intelligible**, but unmistakably **robotic** and **deep**. It should “sit” on a tempo grid at **65 BPM in 4/4**, with a musical performance that makes the listener *feel* the structure.

Key vibes:
- **Crisp**: clear consonants, controlled top end (no harsh hiss).
- **Deep**: slightly lowered perceived pitch / formant, solid low-mid body.
- **Robotic synthesized**: vocoder/bitcrush/formant shift, subtle tuning/quantization.
- **Heavy dub echo**: tempo-synced delay with feedback and filtered repeats; one or two “echo throws” for drama.

## Timing concept: 2 bars + emphasis on beat 9
Interpretation: build a clear 2-bar setup, then land the **strongest accent on beat 9** (Bar 3 Beat 1). This creates a satisfying “arrival” moment.

- Tempo: **65 BPM**
- Meter: **4/4**
- Beat count (quarters):
  - Bar 1 = beats **1–4**
  - Bar 2 = beats **5–8**
  - Bar 3 starts at beat **9** (the emphasis target)

### Phrase placement overview
- **Bar 1 (beats 1–4):** establish the voice + groove with “Toot Toot”
- **Bar 2 (beats 5–8):** leave space / anticipation; optionally a short robotic pickup or breath-like synth noise
- **Bar 3 beat 1 (beat 9):** **hit “Engineering”** (or the “EN-” syllable) as the main accent, then let the dub echoes bloom.

## Beat-mapped performance script
This is a *performance score* for the audio engineer/TTS editor. Exact milliseconds can be derived from the BPM grid.

### Option A (recommended): “Engineering” lands on beat 9
**Bar 1**
- Beat 1: “TOOT” (short, percussive, crisp ‘T’)
- Beat 2: “TOOT” (slightly shorter; leave room for tail)
- Beat 3–4: space (let early echo establish the dub feel)

**Bar 2**
- Beat 5–6: space or subtle robotic pickup (e.g., a quiet “en—” glitch, or filtered noise)
- Beat 7–8: **build anticipation** (delay feedback rises slightly; optional tiny “pre-echo”)

**Bar 3**
- **Beat 9 (Bar 3 Beat 1): “EN-”** with the strongest emphasis (level + timbre)
- Beat 10: “GI-”
- Beat 11: “NEER-”
- Beat 12: “-ING” (can be clipped/tight; echoes carry the sustain)

**Dub echo direction:**
- Put a pronounced echo throw on **beat 9** (Engineering start). The dry voice hits hard, then 1/4-note or dotted-8 repeats cascade with filtering.

### Option B: Entire phrase lands as a 3-bar callout
- Beat 1: “Toot”
- Beat 2: “Toot”
- Beat 3–4: rest
- Beat 5: “Engi-” (quiet)
- Beat 6: “neer-” (quiet)
- Beat 7–8: rest
- **Beat 9: “ING!”** (exaggerated accent; almost like a stamped tag)

Use if you want the “9th beat emphasis” to be *a final punctuation*.

## Pronunciation + articulation notes
- “Toot Toot” should be **staccato**, almost like a train-horn syllable, but spoken.
- “Engineering” should be **cleanly segmented** into syllables so the beat grid is obvious.
- Robotic but understandable: avoid over-crushing the consonants; do the “robot” mostly via formant/vocoder layers.

## FX / sound design suggestions (for later steps)
- **Voice source:** any TTS is fine if it’s consistent; choose one with clear consonants.
- **Robotization chain (suggested order):**
  1) High-pass cleanup (remove rumble)
  2) Formant shift / pitch down slightly (keep intelligibility)
  3) Vocoder or subtle ring-mod (blend, not 100% wet)
  4) Bitcrush or sample-rate reduction (light touch)
  5) EQ: add presence around 2–5 kHz, tame harshness 6–9 kHz
  6) Limiter ceiling around -1 dBFS
- **Dub delay:** tempo-synced to 65 BPM. Start with **1/4-note** delay, moderate feedback, and a low-pass filter that darkens repeats. Automate a stronger send on beat 9.

## Deliverable guidance for the Core Worker
- Target length: ~6–10 seconds including echo tail.
- Keep a little headroom; echoes shouldn’t clip.
- Make the beat grid audible via timing (even without drums).

## Acceptance checklist (story-level)
- Listener can *count* into the arrival, and beat 9 feels like the main hit.
- Phrase is intelligible (“Toot Toot Engineering” clearly heard at least once dry).
- Dub echo is a defining character, not a subtle reverb.
