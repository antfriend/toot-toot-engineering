# STORYTELLER (cycle-01)

## Creative intent
A tiny “life-in-a-minute” story: a bonsai’s entire life compressed into a loop. The zoetrope is the stage; each frame is a vignette. The feeling should be warm, playful, and game-like (rounded forms, readable silhouettes, charming exaggeration), with a satisfying tactile surface.

## Visual language ("Marioland"-inspired without IP)
- **Silhouette-first**: chunky trunk, oversized leaves/pads, simplified root flare.
- **Readable staging**: each growth phase should be unmistakable even at small scale.
- **Texture hierarchy**:
  - Tree: deep bark grooves + subtle leaf-vein bumps.
  - Base: light brick/mosaic texture so it reads but doesn’t steal focus.
- **Playful exaggerations**:
  - The sprout’s cotyledons are comically round.
  - The mature bonsai’s canopy pads are puffy “cloud clumps.”

## Growth sequence (12 frames recommended)
Twelve frames balances smooth motion with print time and circumference.

Frame-by-frame beats:
1. **Seed**: a small seed nestled in a shallow mound.
2. **Crack**: seed split; a tiny root nub appears.
3. **Sprout**: stem emerges; two round cotyledons.
4. **First leaves**: cotyledons + one small true leaf.
5. **Sapling**: thin trunk, 3–4 leaves.
6. **Young tree**: trunk thickens; first bend begins.
7. **Training wire moment (implied)**: trunk shows a gentle S-curve (no actual wire needed).
8. **Branching**: first lateral branch supports canopy.
9. **Pad formation**: two canopy “puffs.”
10. **Bonsai character**: clear root flare + 3 canopy pads.
11. **Mature bonsai**: thicker trunk, deeper bark, 4–5 canopy pads.
12. **Hero pose**: most expressive silhouette; slightly wider canopy, confident stance.

## Printability notes to guide modeling
- Keep each frame as a **self-supporting sculpture**: use the trunk/branches to hold canopy volumes.
- Avoid leaf pads as thin plates; make them **rounded blobs** with minimum thickness.
- Provide a consistent “foot” connection to the base for strength (a small mound/soil bump under each tree).
- Ensure each frame has enough lateral spacing to avoid fusing during slicing.

## Base design beats
- Base should feel like a small plaza/planter ring.
- Mosaic/brick texture should be shallow and regular.
- The center hole (30 mm) reads as a hub; consider a subtle chamfer for comfort.

## Hand-off to Orchestrator / Core worker
- Recommend **12 frames** unless mechanical constraints suggest otherwise.
- Emphasize exaggerated silhouettes and tactile bark grooves.
- Use soil mounds under trees to increase strength and transition from base to trunk.
