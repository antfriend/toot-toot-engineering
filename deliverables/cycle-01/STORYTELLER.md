# STORYTELLER (cycle-01)

## The creative thread for cycle-01
Cycle-01 is a “make-a-factory” story: we’re not producing a comic *yet*—we’re forging the workshop that can reliably produce one. The narrative thread is therefore **a foundry run**:

- **The Workshop**: the repo itself—tools on the walls (roles), rails on the floor (PLAN), a ledger on the bench (LOG).
- **The Workpiece**: a single, tangible artifact that proves the furnace is hot and the tooling aligns.
- **The Foreman’s Call**: “One step, one role, one artifact—move the work down the line.”

This narrative is functional: it gives each role a job that “makes sense” in-world and makes decisions easier (“does this help the foundry produce output?”).

## Story beats (mapped to workflow steps)
1. **Bootstrap (completed)**: The foreman reads the order form and lays out stations.
2. **Storyteller (this step)**: The foreman pins a short myth to the wall so everyone builds the *same thing*.
3. **Orchestrator**: Chalks the path on the floor and labels bins.
4. **Core worker**: Strikes metal—creates the first produced piece.
5. **Reviewer**: Measures tolerances and checks for burrs.
6. **Delivery packager**: Wraps, labels, and writes handling notes.
7. **Retrospective**: Updates the playbook so the next run is smoother.

## Narrative quality targets (what “excellent” means here)
- **Coherence**: every asset should read like it belongs to the same run.
- **Concrete proof**: the “foundry run” must yield a physical token (generated file), not only prose.
- **Low ambiguity**: future steps should have a clear target to build and validate.

## Recommendation for the primary production artifact (to guide step 5)
To keep cycle-01 small but real, produce a **Cycle-01 Foundry Token**:

- A simple **SVG badge** generated by a small Python script (deterministic output), e.g.:
  - Text: “TTE cycle-01”
  - Motto: “One step. One role. One artifact.”
  - A stylized gear/rail motif (simple shapes).
- Store output at: `deliverables/cycle-01/assets/cycle-01-badge.svg`
- Document the artifact in: `deliverables/cycle-01/SOLUTION.md`

Why SVG?
- It’s a tangible output with a low dependency footprint.
- It’s inspectable in git diffs.
- It creates a natural bridge to an optional future SVG/PDF pipeline without forcing it now.

## Hand-off notes to Orchestrator/Core Worker
- If we generate an SVG, the SVG engineer step remains optional; we can treat it as “light guidance” embedded in the Core Worker’s notes unless the Orchestrator decides to include the dedicated role.
- Prefer a Python generator script in the cycle folder to avoid OS-specific shell issues.

## Open questions
- None blocking. The artifact choice above is sufficiently scoped for a single cycle.
