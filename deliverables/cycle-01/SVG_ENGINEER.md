# SVG_ENGINEER (cycle-01)

## Assessment
The prompt centers on an animated GIF and cinematic banner, not SVG output. SVG is not required for the primary deliverables.

## Constraints and notes
- If vector assets are needed (e.g., logo or banner title treatments), SVG can be used as source art and rasterized for GIF output.
- Avoid heavy SVG filters or large embedded images; rasterize early for consistent GIF rendering.

## Recommendation
Proceed without SVG-specific production steps unless the Core worker needs a vector banner title for crisp scaling.
