# SVG_ENGINEER (Cycle 01)

## Applicability
This cycle's primary output is an STL for 3D printing, not an SVG. No SVG-specific engineering is required.

## Notes
- If an SVG logo or badge is embedded in documentation, ensure it is converted to a compatible mesh or used only in 2D assets.
- Continue without SVG pipeline steps.
