# SVG_ENGINEER (cycle-01)

The cycle-01 prompt is for a **3D printable STL** (gearbox), not an SVG-focused deliverable.

## Determination
- SVG engineering is **not required** for cycle-01.

## If SVG is needed later
If a later cycle needs SVG (e.g., laser-cut gears, documentation diagrams, or printable templates), recommended deliverables would be:
- 2D gear profiles (with tooth form notes)
- Dimensioned assembly diagrams
- Export guidance for Inkscape / Illustrator
