# BOOTSTRAP (Cycle 02)

## Prompt
Create a cinematic banner animation (16:9 and 3:1 variants) that showcases `deliverables/cycle-01/bonsai-marioland.stl` rotating like a GitHub STL viewer: slow, smooth turntable motion, soft studio lighting, subtle depth-of-field feel, and a clean gradient backdrop. Export a short looping MP4 and GIF, plus a still hero frame; include the Toot Toot Engineering logo as a small corner bug.

## Interpretation
We need a cinematic, rotating banner animation based on the existing bonsai STL. The outputs should include two aspect ratios (16:9 and 3:1), a looping animation, and a hero still, with a small Toot Toot Engineering logo. Because this repo is tool-limited, we may deliver a self-contained HTML/CSS/JS animation that can be captured into MP4/GIF externally if needed.

## Proposed team composition
- Bootstrap: confirm scope, constraints, and plan adjustments.
- Storyteller: define the cinematic mood, lighting, and motion beats.
- Core worker: implement the banner animation and stills using the STL.
- Reviewer: check correctness and any gaps in outputs.
- Delivery packager: assemble final assets and export notes with logo inclusion.

## Objectives
- Create a looping, cinematic turntable animation that reads like a GitHub STL viewer.
- Provide both 16:9 and 3:1 banner variants.
- Include a small Toot Toot Engineering logo as a corner bug.
- Document how to capture MP4/GIF if not rendered directly.

## Recommended plan adjustments
- Add a lightweight preview or capture note to help export MP4/GIF if needed.
- Downsample triangles for real-time playback if required.

## Risks and assumptions
- Tooling may not support direct MP4/GIF encoding in-repo; provide capture-ready animation.
- The STL is voxel-heavy; real-time rendering may need simplification.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose 1)
1) Produce a print-style poster layout that pairs the bonsai render with a short creative caption and logo badge.
2) Build a small interactive web viewer that lets users rotate and zoom the bonsai STL with lighting presets.
3) Generate a monochrome, laser-engraving-ready 2D relief derived from the bonsai silhouette.
