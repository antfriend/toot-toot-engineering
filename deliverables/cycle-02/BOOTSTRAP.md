# BOOTSTRAP

## Prompt
Build on the cycle-01 stained glass SVG by adding realistic lighting effects with CSS (glow, bloom, directional light) and include a short lighting notes section.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap
- Storyteller
- SVG engineer
- Orchestrator
- Core worker
- Reviewer
- Delivery packager
- Retrospective

## Objectives
- Produce a self-contained HTML demo that applies CSS-based lighting effects to the existing stained glass SVG.
- Preserve the original SVG artwork while enhancing realism through glow, bloom, and directional light overlays.
- Document the lighting approach and how to view the result.

## Recommended plan adjustments
- Define core worker outputs: `deliverables/cycle-02/lighting-demo.html` and `deliverables/cycle-02/SOLUTION.md`.
- Treat the SVG engineer step as required because the SVG is embedded and styled with CSS.
- Add reviewer checks for browser support of blend modes and CSS filters.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one)
1. Add subtle animated light flicker and dust motes to the lighting demo while keeping it accessible and performant.
2. Create a named-window variant (e.g., Chartres rose window) using the existing structure but revised motifs and palette.
3. Package the stained glass artwork into a printable poster with typographic credits and a historical note.

## Retrospective recommendations
- Document lighting decisions and CSS variables in the solution notes for reuse.
- Keep overlay layers minimal to avoid performance regressions.
- Add a short browser support note for blend modes in future deliveries.

Bootstrap can implement these recommendations after you select a cycle-03 prompt.
