# Cycle 02 Bootstrap

## Prompt
Build a short motion spec and storyboard that explains how the Mortal Engines workflow could be animated in a 10-second intro.

## Interpretation
We are translating the Mortal Engines workflow into a concise 10-second intro. The output should include a beat-by-beat motion plan and a storyboard that visually narrates the workflow: prompt → plan → production → review → delivery. The tone should feel energetic, mechanical, and optimistic.

## Objectives
- Produce a clear 10-second motion spec with timing and transitions.
- Provide a storyboard describing each shot and its visual focus.
- Align narrative beats with Mortal Engines metaphors: gears, rails, steam, and structured flow.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap: define scope, constraints, and plan adjustments.
- Storyteller: shape the narrative beats and highlight the magic moments.
- Orchestrator: confirm plan sequencing and role expectations.
- Core worker: build the motion spec and storyboard assets.
- Reviewer: validate completeness and clarity.
- Delivery packager: assemble delivery notes and update release tracking.
- Retrospective: capture improvements for next cycle.

## Plan adjustments
- Keep the deliverable lightweight and readable: 10-second timeline with 6-8 beats.
- Emphasize cinematic clarity over visual detail; the storyboard can be text-only if needed.

## Risks
- Overloading the sequence with too many steps may reduce clarity.
- Missing the narrative arc could make the intro feel like a checklist instead of a story.

## Success criteria
- A concise timeline with durations, transitions, and key visuals.
- Storyboard frames that map directly to the workflow stages.
- Narrative feels cohesive and inspiring, not purely procedural.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one)
1. Expand the storyboard into a 30-second version with sound design notes.
2. Create a style guide for the Mortal Engines motion language (color, type, motion curves).
3. Produce a 5-slide deck summarizing the workflow for onboarding.

## Retrospective recommendations
- Consider a dedicated sound-design role for motion-heavy deliverables.
- Define a reusable storyboard template for future cycles.

## Offer to implement
If you pick a next-cycle prompt, I can update `PLAN.md` to start cycle-03 and carry the improvements forward.

## Retrospective update
- Add a reusable storyboard template with timing fields to reduce future setup time.
- Consider an Audio role or sound-design checklist when motion is the primary deliverable.
