# Cycle 02 Review

## Checks
- Prompt alignment: yes, a 10-second motion spec and storyboard are provided.
- Narrative clarity: beats map to workflow stages and feel cohesive.
- Completeness: includes timing, transitions, and style notes.

## Risks
- Without visuals, timing interpretation depends on the reader; consider adding thumbnails in a future cycle.
- Sound cues are implied; explicit audio notes could improve production readiness.

## Required fixes
- None.
