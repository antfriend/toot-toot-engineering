# Cycle 02 Solution

## Overview
This solution provides a 10-second motion spec and storyboard describing how to animate the Mortal Engines workflow as an intro sequence. It translates the workflow into a cinematic, mechanical narrative with clear timing and transitions.

## Motion spec (10 seconds)
1. Sparked prompt (0.0-1.5s)
   - Visual: Glowing prompt text drops into a dark field, igniting a small engine core.
   - Motion: Quick ease-out drop, flash of light on impact.
   - Audio: Soft spark + subtle engine hum begins.

2. Bootstrap pulse (1.5-3.0s)
   - Visual: The core expands into a circular ring; orbiting role icons appear.
   - Motion: Radial expansion, icons fade-in with staggered timing.
   - Transition: Ring locks into place with a metallic click.

3. Storyteller sweep (3.0-4.2s)
   - Visual: A luminous ribbon sweeps across the ring, tracing an arc.
   - Motion: Smooth spline sweep, slight glow trail.
   - Tone: Warm highlight to emphasize narrative magic.

4. Plan assembly (4.2-6.0s)
   - Visual: Rails and gears click into a clean workflow diagram.
   - Motion: Mechanical snap-in, gears rotate as they settle.
   - Transition: Diagram locks with a subtle pulse.

5. Production surge (6.0-7.6s)
   - Visual: The machine hums; output tiles glow and stack.
   - Motion: Upward lift with ease-in; sparks flicker.
   - Tone: Bright accents show progress.

6. Review stamp (7.6-8.8s)
   - Visual: A seal presses down on the output, confirming review.
   - Motion: Fast drop + rebound, dust puff.
   - Audio: Firm stamp thud.

7. Delivery flourish (8.8-10.0s)
   - Visual: A bright badge reads “Toot Toot Engineering,” then resolves to logo.
   - Motion: Badge fade-in with gentle zoom; logo settles center.
   - End: Quick glow pulse then hold on logo.

## Storyboard (text)
- Frame 1: Dark background, prompt text falls like a spark into a small engine core.
- Frame 2: The core expands into a glowing ring with role icons orbiting.
- Frame 3: A ribbon of light traces the narrative arc across the ring.
- Frame 4: Rails and gears assemble into a neat workflow diagram.
- Frame 5: Outputs glow and stack as the machine hums.
- Frame 6: A seal stamps the output, signaling review complete.
- Frame 7: Final badge and logo lockup fills the frame.

## Visual style notes
- Palette: warm highlights (gold/orange) against cool machinery blues.
- Typography: bold, industrial wordmark; minimal secondary text.
- Motion: smooth ease-in-out for narrative beats, snappier mechanical snaps.
