# STORYTELLER (cycle-02)

## Central performance thread
Double-time delivery at 130 BPM keeps the tag energetic while preserving the signature dub-echo cadence. Consonants should punch forward: clean “t” in “Toot” and crisp “g / n / ng” edges in “Engineering.” The 9th beat (bar 3 beat 1) is the impact moment for the phrase “Engineering.”

## Beat map (130 BPM, 4/4)
Quarter note = 60 / 130 = **0.4615s**

**Bar 1**
- Beat 1 (0.000s): “Toot”
- Beat 2 (0.4615s): “Toot”

**Bar 2**
- Beats 5–8: rests or tailing reverb/delay

**Bar 3**
- Beat 9 (3.692s): “En-” (accent)
- Beat 10 (4.154s): “-gi-”
- Beat 11 (4.615s): “-neer”
- Beat 12 (5.077s): “-ing”

## Consonant articulation guidance
- **“Toot”**: sharp front “t” and a brief end “t” click.
- **“Engineering”**: light “en” onset, stronger “g” attack, and a crisp “ng” finish.
- Use short, bright noise bursts layered on the syllable onsets to heighten consonant clarity.

## Dub echo direction
- Tempo-synced quarter-note delay.
- Stronger throw around beat 9 to emphasize the new phrase.
- Delay feedback should be darker but still preserve consonant edges in the first repeats.
