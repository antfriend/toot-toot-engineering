# STORYTELLER

## Core interpretation
The stained glass should feel alive in a cathedral nave: light pools across the panes, the lead lines cast faint shadows, and the glow blooms outward into the surrounding air. The lighting is a character of its own, revealing depth without changing the underlying glasswork.

## Narrative focus
- Emphasize directionality: light enters from a high-left angle, warming the upper arc and spilling into the center.
- Bloom and glow should feel soft, not neon; the glass remains saturated while the light diffuses.
- Keep the surrounding environment dim to heighten contrast and make the window read as luminous.

## Visual beats
1. A dim cathedral backdrop to establish contrast.
2. A warm bloom halo around the window edges.
3. A concentrated highlight zone across the rose window.
4. Subtle vignetting to focus attention inward.

## Direction for CSS execution
- Use layered gradients and blend modes to create lighting overlays.
- Add multiple drop shadows to simulate glass glow and ambient spill.
- Keep effects controllable via CSS variables for easy tuning.

## Success criteria
- The lighting reads as realistic and directional.
- The stained glass remains crisp and legible.
- The demo is self-contained and easy to view.
