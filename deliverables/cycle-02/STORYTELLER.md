# STORYTELLER (Cycle 02)

## Creative thread
A cinematic studio turntable for the bonsai: slow, calm rotation, soft light bloom, and a gentle gradient backdrop that feels like a high-end product reveal. The motion should echo GitHub's STL viewer but with a more cinematic, gallery-quality polish.

## Visual and motion cues
- Slow, steady rotation (one full turn in 12-16 seconds).
- Slight top-down tilt to show canopy depth.
- Subtle specular highlight and soft shadows for sculpted depth.
- Clean gradient background that fades from warm to cool.

## Composition
- Centered model with generous negative space.
- Logo as a small, quiet corner bug.
- Avoid distracting UI elements; keep the focus on the bonsai.

## Atmosphere
- Calm, gallery-like presentation.
- Gentle lighting falloff; no harsh shadows.
