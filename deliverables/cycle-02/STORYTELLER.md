# Cycle 02 Storyteller

## Story thesis
The Mortal Engines intro is a 10-second spark that shows a prompt igniting a living factory. Each beat reveals a stage of the workflow as a mechanical transformation, ending in a polished delivery.

## Magic moments
- The prompt arrives like a spark that wakes the engine.
- Gears and rails assemble themselves into a visible plan.
- The machine outputs a glowing deliverable with a confident stamp.

## Narrative beats (10 seconds)
1. Sparked prompt (0.0-1.5s): A glowing text prompt drops into frame, igniting a small engine core.
2. Bootstrap pulse (1.5-3.0s): The core expands into a ring, revealing role icons orbiting.
3. Storyteller sweep (3.0-4.2s): A ribbon of light traces the narrative arc across the ring.
4. Plan assembly (4.2-6.0s): Rails and gears click into a tidy workflow diagram.
5. Production surge (6.0-7.6s): The machine hums; outputs glow and stack.
6. Review stamp (7.6-8.8s): A seal presses down, indicating validation.
7. Delivery flourish (8.8-10.0s): A bright badge reads “Toot Toot Engineering,” then fades to logo.

## Director notes
- Keep transitions smooth and readable; prioritize silhouettes over fine detail.
- Use warm highlights for narrative beats and cool tones for machinery.
- Make the Storyteller beat feel like a graceful, cinematic sweep.

## Requests to the Orchestrator
- No new roles needed.
- Ensure the motion spec includes timing and easing hints.
