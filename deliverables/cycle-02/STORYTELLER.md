# STORYTELLER (cycle-02)

## Creative throughline
A calm orbital dance: the Earth sits steady while "Hello World" glides along a luminous orbit, like a satellite inscription tracing a ceremonial ring.

## Visual direction
- Earth: stylized, clean shading with a subtle atmosphere glow.
- Orbit: thin, elegant ring with a faint trail; text follows the orbit path.
- Background: deep-space gradient with sparse stars.
- Palette: cool blues for Earth, warm gold/cream for the text.

## Motion notes
- Orbit speed: slow and readable, full loop every 6–8 seconds.
- Text should remain upright or gently tangent to the orbit for legibility.
- Loop must be seamless and continuous.

## Composition targets
- Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 preferred, with Earth centered and orbit wide.
- Text path radius: ~1.3–1.5x Earth radius for clarity.
- Logo: small Toot Toot Engineering mark placed in a corner or subtly along the orbit.

## Typography
- Use a high-contrast serif or cinematic display face (fallback to standard serif if limited).
- Keep letter spacing slightly expanded for readability along the curve.
