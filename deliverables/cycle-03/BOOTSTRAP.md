# BOOTSTRAP

## Prompt
Add subtle animated light flicker and dust motes to the lighting demo while keeping it accessible and performant.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap
- Storyteller
- SVG engineer
- Orchestrator
- Core worker
- Reviewer
- Delivery packager
- Retrospective

## Objectives
- Extend the lighting demo with gentle, tasteful animation that enhances realism.
- Keep performance steady with lightweight CSS animations and minimal DOM overhead.
- Document animation intent and how to view/disable if needed.

## Recommended plan adjustments
- Define core worker outputs: `deliverables/cycle-03/lighting-demo-animated.html` and `deliverables/cycle-03/SOLUTION.md`.
- Treat the SVG engineer step as required due to inline SVG + animated overlays.
- Add reviewer checks for motion sensitivity and reduced-motion support.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one)
1. Create a named-window variant (e.g., Chartres rose window) using the existing structure but revised motifs and palette.
2. Package the stained glass artwork into a printable poster with typographic credits and a historical note.
3. Create a short, narrated description of the window and its lighting as a companion text piece.

## Retrospective recommendations
- Ensure all animated overlays respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Keep particle counts low to avoid performance regressions.
- Note any animation tuning settings in solution notes for easy iteration.

Bootstrap can implement these recommendations after you select a cycle-04 prompt.
