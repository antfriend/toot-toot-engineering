# BOOTSTRAP

## Prompt
Accentuate a top-down Star Trek Enterprise appearance in the lighting demo and make the lighting animation dramatic.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap
- Storyteller
- SVG engineer
- Orchestrator
- Core worker
- Reviewer
- Delivery packager
- Retrospective

## Objectives
- Create an updated lighting demo with a top-down Enterprise silhouette integrated into the composition.
- Increase lighting animation intensity while preserving readability of the stained glass artwork.
- Document the dramatic lighting approach and accessibility considerations.

## Recommended plan adjustments
- Define core worker outputs: `deliverables/cycle-04/lighting-demo-enterprise.html` and `deliverables/cycle-04/SOLUTION.md`.
- Treat the SVG engineer step as required because the SVG is embedded and composited with new overlays.
- Add reviewer checks for motion intensity and reduced-motion handling.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one)
1. Refine the Enterprise overlay into a more detailed vector emblem with subtle metallic shading.
2. Build a print-ready poster that merges the stained glass with the Enterprise silhouette and credits.
3. Create a short design write-up explaining the sci-fi/cathedral fusion choices.

## Retrospective recommendations
- Keep overlay layers named and documented to ease future edits.
- Gate dramatic motion behind `prefers-reduced-motion` fallbacks.
- Document any silhouette changes in the solution notes for clarity.

Bootstrap can implement these recommendations after you select a cycle-05 prompt.
