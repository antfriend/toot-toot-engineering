# BOOTSTRAP (cycle-04)

## Prompt
- Source: human selection from cycle-03 prompts
- Prompt: Build an illustrated process map showing how the concept factory turns prompts into artifacts.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap
- Storyteller
- Orchestrator
- Core worker
- Image producer
- Reviewer
- Delivery packager
- Retrospective

## Objectives
- Create an illustrated process map that visualizes the Mortal Engines pipeline as a concept factory.
- Keep the map legible and modular so it can be reused in onboarding or presentations.
- Ensure final deliverables include a small Toot Toot Engineering logo appropriate for the media.

## Plan adjustments
- Keep the image producer step to generate the map visuals.

## Risks and assumptions
- The map should balance clarity with visual richness; avoid overcrowding.
- The process stages should align with the current plan roles.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one for cycle-05)
1. Convert the process map into a short animated explainer storyboard.
2. Design a printable poster of the concept factory pipeline with typography refinements.
3. Create a compact "cheat sheet" card for the Mortal Engines workflow.

## Retrospective updates
- Recommendation: Add simplified map variants (stacked or mobile) to support narrow layouts.
- Recommendation: Maintain a consistent icon set for role nodes across future maps.
- Offer: I can implement these recommendations and reset the plan once a cycle-05 prompt is selected.
