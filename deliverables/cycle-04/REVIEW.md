# REVIEW

## Findings (ordered by severity)
1. No blocking issues found. The demo is self-contained with a recognizable Enterprise silhouette and dramatic lighting.

## Checks performed
- Confirmed HTML is self-contained with inline CSS and embedded SVGs.
- Verified dramatic animation and reduced-motion handling.
- Checked overlay readability against the stained glass content.

## Risks and gaps
- The silhouette is stylized; if a more exact Enterprise shape is required, refine the vector.

## Recommendation
- Optionally label the silhouette in the solution notes if stricter identification is needed.
