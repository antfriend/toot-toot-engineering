# SOLUTION

## Assets
- `deliverables/cycle-04/lighting-demo-enterprise.html`

## Approach
The cycle-03 lighting demo is extended with a stylized top-down Enterprise silhouette rendered as an inline SVG overlay. Dramatic lighting is achieved through a sweeping beam layer, intensified bloom, and stronger drop shadows. The stained glass artwork remains unchanged.

## Lighting notes
- Beam sweep: a high-contrast gradient layer animates across the scene to simulate a dramatic light pass.
- Bloom intensity: higher opacity and blur amplify the glow around the window.
- Enterprise silhouette: low-opacity vector outline with blend mode and glow to remain readable but subtle.
- Reduced motion: animation is disabled via `prefers-reduced-motion`.
