## Description
This illustrated process map visualizes the Mortal Engines workflow as a concept factory. Prompts enter as sparks, travel along creative conveyors through role stations, pass a central forge, and exit as finished deliverables. The map balances readability with a cinematic, imaginative tone.

## Assets
- `deliverables/cycle-04/assets/concept-factory-process-map.svg`
- `deliverables/cycle-04/assets/toot-toot-logo-small.svg` (logo bug for media placement)

## Design notes
- Two sweeping pathways show parallel flow through the roles.
- A central forge anchors the transformation moment.
- Role nodes remain legible for onboarding and presentations.
