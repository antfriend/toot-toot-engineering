# STORYTELLER

## Core interpretation
The stained glass glows like a ceremonial shrine, while a top-down silhouette of the Enterprise hovers above it like a guardian starship. The lighting shifts become more cinematic: sweeping beams, deeper contrast, and a heightened sense of energy.

## Narrative focus
- The Enterprise silhouette should read clearly without overpowering the window.
- Lighting feels dramatic, as if the ship is casting or catching intense beams.
- Motion remains elegant but bolder than in cycle-03.

## Visual beats
1. A crisp Enterprise outline layered behind the window, slightly offset for depth.
2. A strong directional beam sweeping from upper-left to lower-right.
3. Intensified bloom and shadow pulses to heighten drama.

## Direction for CSS execution
- Use a high-contrast gradient sweep with animated opacity.
- Apply brighter bloom passes and stronger drop shadows for punch.
- Keep the silhouette subtle via opacity and blend modes.

## Success criteria
- The Enterprise silhouette is recognizable at a glance.
- Lighting feels dramatic and dynamic without obscuring the art.
- Reduced-motion users still see a strong static composition.
