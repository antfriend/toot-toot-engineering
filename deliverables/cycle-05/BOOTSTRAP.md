# BOOTSTRAP

## Prompt
Make the lighting effect play out dramatically on the SVG facets.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap
- Storyteller
- SVG engineer
- Orchestrator
- Core worker
- Reviewer
- Delivery packager
- Retrospective

## Objectives
- Create a new lighting demo where dramatic light sweeps across stained glass facets.
- Keep the SVG artwork intact while animating facet highlights via overlay layers.
- Provide reduced-motion support and document the lighting approach.

## Recommended plan adjustments
- Define core worker outputs: `deliverables/cycle-05/lighting-demo-facets.html` and `deliverables/cycle-05/SOLUTION.md`.
- Treat the SVG engineer step as required due to overlay alignment needs.
- Add reviewer checks for reduced-motion and performance.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one)
1. Refine the facet highlights into a more detailed, pane-by-pane mapping.
2. Create a print-ready poster that captures the dramatic facet lighting in a static still.
3. Write a short technical note on how the facet highlights were aligned and animated.

## Retrospective recommendations
- Keep overlay geometry documented for future alignment tweaks.
- Ensure animation timing remains readable and not distracting.
- Note any facet geometry changes in solution notes for clarity.

Bootstrap can implement these recommendations after you select a cycle-06 prompt.
