# BOOTSTRAP (cycle-05)

## Prompt
- Source: human selection from cycle-04 prompts
- Prompt: Convert the process map into a short animated explainer storyboard in super cinematic aspect ratio SVG.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap
- Storyteller
- Orchestrator
- Core worker
- Image producer
- Reviewer
- Delivery packager
- Retrospective

## Objectives
- Storyboard a short explainer based on the concept factory process map.
- Define key frames, captions, and pacing for a 20–30 second piece.
- Ensure final deliverables include a small Toot Toot Engineering logo appropriate for the media.

## Plan adjustments
- Keep the image producer step for frame sketches or visual boards.

## Risks and assumptions
- Storyboard should remain concise to avoid scope creep.
- Timing should map cleanly to existing process stages.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one for cycle-06)
1. Produce a narrated script to accompany the storyboard beats.
2. Build a lightweight motion prototype of one storyboard scene.
3. Create a packaging guide for exporting the storyboard into video.

## Retrospective updates
- Recommendation: Add per-panel timing callouts directly on storyboard frames for faster edit handoff.
- Recommendation: Standardize a 3:1 frame template for future cinematic storyboards.
- Offer: I can implement these recommendations and reset the plan once a cycle-06 prompt is selected.
