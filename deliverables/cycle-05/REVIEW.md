# REVIEW

## Findings (ordered by severity)
1. No blocking issues found. The demo is self-contained, and facet lighting reads as a dramatic sweep.

## Checks performed
- Confirmed HTML is self-contained with inline CSS and embedded SVG.
- Verified facet highlight animation and reduced-motion fallback.
- Checked visual readability against the stained glass content.

## Risks and gaps
- Facet geometry is approximate; refine alignment if stricter matching is required.

## Recommendation
- Optional: add more facet polygons if you want finer-grained light travel.
