# STORYTELLER (cycle-05)

## Story spine
The explainer opens on a cinematic factory horizon, then zooms into the process map as ideas flow through each role. The storyboard should feel like a guided camera move across stations, ending in a bright artifact launch.

## Scene beats (20–30s)
1. Wide establishing: glowing factory skyline and conveyor lights.
2. Prompt intake: sparks enter the system, title card appears.
3. Role stations: orbiting nodes ignite in sequence (Bootstrap → Storyteller → Orchestrator → Image Producer → Core Worker).
4. Review + delivery: quality gates flash, package seals.
5. Release: artifact launches with logo bug and closing caption.

## Caption ideas
- "Every prompt begins as a spark."
- "Roles refine the idea into motion."
- "Quality, delivery, and release."
- "Toot Toot Engineering."

## Tone
Cinematic, inventive, and optimistic with a sense of scale.
