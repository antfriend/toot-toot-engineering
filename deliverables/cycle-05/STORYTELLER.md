# STORYTELLER

## Core interpretation
Light sweeps across the stained glass like a dramatic spotlight, catching and igniting individual facets in sequence. Each pane flares briefly, then yields to the next, creating a cinematic ripple across the window.

## Narrative focus
- The light should feel directional and purposeful, like a beam traveling across the window.
- Facet highlights should emphasize geometry without overwhelming the stained glass colors.
- The effect should read as luminous glass rather than a flat overlay.

## Visual beats
1. A leading sweep that enters from the top-left, igniting upper panes.
2. A mid-window flare focused on the rose and lancets.
3. A trailing glow that fades as it reaches the lower medallion.

## Direction for CSS execution
- Animate facet highlight shapes in staggered phases.
- Use blend modes (screen/overlay) and soft blur to simulate refraction.
- Provide reduced-motion fallback to a static, dramatic highlight state.

## Success criteria
- Highlights feel like light traveling across facets.
- The stained glass remains readable and rich.
- Reduced-motion users still see a strong lighting composition.
