## Entries
- Step: 1 (cycle-01)
- Role: Bootstrap
- Summary: Interpreted the prompt for a 3D-printable Marioland-style bonsai STL; proposed roles, technical approach (voxel/marching cubes for robust watertight mesh), and definition of done.
- Decisions: Prefer deterministic procedural generation with voxelization + marching cubes to avoid fragile booleans; include validation and scaling guidance.
- Open questions: Target printing process (FDM vs resin) not specified; assumed FDM-friendly minimum thickness.
- Next step: Storyteller
