## Entries
- Step: 1 (cycle-01)
- Role: Bootstrap
- Summary: Interpreted the cycle-01 prompt (3D-printable bonsai STL with cartoony “Marioland” vibe), proposed a procedural STL generation approach, identified printability constraints, and enumerated concrete cycle deliverables.
- Decisions: Removed/avoided the SVG-focused step for this cycle; recommended adding explicit 3D mesh validation and print notes steps.
- Open questions: What tooling/libraries are available in the workspace for procedural mesh generation and STL export (Python deps, etc.)? What target printer/process (FDM vs resin) should we optimize minimum feature thickness for?
- Next step: Storyteller
